# Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file in the emp-mgpu repository defines the services and their configurations. This document explains the structure and purpose of each component.

## Base Service Configuration

The docker-compose file starts with a base service definition that is reused across all services:

```yaml
x-base-service: &base-service
  env_file:
    - .env.local
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    platforms:
      - linux/amd64
    args:
      FORCE_FRESH_CLONE: ${FORCE_FRESH_CLONE:-false}
  ports:
    - "3188:3188"
    - "3189:3189"
    - "3190:3190"
    - "3191:3191"
    - "3192:3192"
    - "3193:3193"
    - "3194:3194"
    - "3195:3195"
  restart: unless-stopped
  platform: linux/amd64
```

This base configuration:
- Uses environment variables from `.env.local`
- Specifies the build context and Dockerfile
- Targets the linux/amd64 platform
- Exposes ports 3188-3195 for various services
- Sets containers to restart automatically unless explicitly stopped

## Services

### ComfyUI (Official)

```yaml
services:
  comfyui:
    <<: *base-service
    container_name: comfy
    image: emprops/comfy:latest
    environment:
      - COMFY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
    build:
      args:
        COMFY_REPO_URL: https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
```

This service:
- Inherits all configuration from the base service
- Uses the container name "comfy"
- Creates an image tagged as "emprops/comfy:latest"
- Uses the official ComfyUI repository

### ComfyUI (EmProps Fork)

```yaml
comfyui-fork:
  <<: *base-service
  container_name: comfy-fork
  image: emprops/comfy-fork:latest
  environment:
    - COMFY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/stakeordie/ComfyUI.git
  build:
    args:
      COMFY_REPO_URL: https://github.com/stakeordie/ComfyUI.git
```

This service:
- Uses the EmProps fork of ComfyUI
- Creates a separate container named "comfy-fork"
- Uses the same base configuration as the official version

### ComfyUI (Development Fork)

```yaml
comfyui-fork-devel:
  <<: *base-service
  container_name: comfy-fork-devel
  image: emprops/comfy-fork-devel:latest
  environment:
    - COMFY_REPO_URL=https://github.com/stakeordie/ComfyUI.git
  build:
    args:
      COMFY_REPO_URL: https://github.com/stakeordie/ComfyUI.git
```

This service:
- This is identical to `comfyui-fork` but has the devel name so that comfy will work with some library that I can't remember lol.

## Usage

### Starting Specific Services

You can start specific services using:

```bash
docker compose up -d comfyui-fork-devel
```

Or start all services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Building Services

To rebuild a specific service:

```bash
docker compose build comfyui
```

Or rebuild all services:

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Environment Variables

The docker-compose.yml file uses several environment variables that should be defined in your `.env.local` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| FORCE_FRESH_CLONE | Whether to force a fresh clone of repositories | false |

## Port Mappings

Each service exposes multiple ports:

| Port | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 3188 | Main ComfyUI interface |
| 3189 | Secondary interface |
| 3190-3195 | Additional services and interfaces |

These ports can be accessed on your host machine to interact with the various ComfyUI instances.
