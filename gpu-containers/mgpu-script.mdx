# mgpu Script

The `mgpu` script is a utility for managing multiple GPU instances of ComfyUI in the emp-mgpu environment. It provides commands for starting, stopping, restarting, and monitoring ComfyUI instances across multiple GPUs.

## Overview

The script is designed to manage ComfyUI instances across multiple GPUs, with each instance assigned to a specific GPU. It's installed in the container at `/usr/local/bin/mgpu` and is available in the system PATH.

## Usage

```bash
mgpu <command> [gpu_id]
```

Where:
- `command` is the operation to perform (start, stop, restart, etc.)
- `gpu_id` is the ID of the GPU to operate on (0, 1, 2, etc., or "all" for all GPUs)

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `start` | Start ComfyUI on specified GPU(s) |
| `stop` | Stop ComfyUI on specified GPU(s) |
| `restart` | Restart ComfyUI on specified GPU(s) |
| `status` | Check status of ComfyUI on specified GPU(s) |
| `logs` | Show logs for ComfyUI on specified GPU(s) |
| `setup` | Set up ComfyUI directory for specified GPU(s) |
| `count` | Show number of GPUs available |

## Examples

### Start ComfyUI

To start ComfyUI on GPU 0:

```bash
mgpu start 0
```

To start ComfyUI on all GPUs:

```bash
mgpu start all
```

### Check Status

To check the status of ComfyUI on GPU 1:

```bash
mgpu status 1
```

To check the status of ComfyUI on all GPUs:

```bash
mgpu status all
```

### View Logs

To view logs for ComfyUI on GPU 0:

```bash
mgpu logs 0
```

## Implementation Details

The script is organized into functions for each operation, with validation to ensure that GPU IDs are valid:

```bash
# Validate GPU ID
validate_gpu_id() {
    local gpu_id=$1

    # Special case for 'all'
    if [ "$gpu_id" = "all" ]; then
        return 0
    fi

    # Check if gpu_id is a number
    if ! [[ "$gpu_id" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
        log "Error: Invalid GPU ID '$gpu_id'. Must be a number or 'all'"
        return 1
    fi

    # Check if gpu_id is within range
    if [ "$gpu_id" -ge "${NUM_GPUS:-0}" ]; then
        log "Error: GPU ID '$gpu_id' is out of range. Must be between 0 and $((NUM_GPUS-1))"
        return 1
    fi

    return 0
}
```

Each operation is implemented as a function that performs the specified action for a single GPU or all GPUs:

```bash
# Function to start a specific GPU service
start_service() {
    local gpu_id=$1
    
    if ! validate_gpu_id "$gpu_id"; then
        return 1
    fi
    
    if [ "$gpu_id" = "all" ]; then
        start_all_services
        return $?
    fi
    
    log "Starting ComfyUI service for GPU $gpu_id"
    service "comfyui_gpu$gpu_id" start
    log "ComfyUI service for GPU $gpu_id started"
}
```

## Environment Variables

The script uses several environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ROOT` | Root directory for ComfyUI instances | `/workspace` |
| `NUM_GPUS` | Number of GPUs available | (auto-detected) |
| `MOCK_GPU` | Whether to mock GPU support | `false` |
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug mode | `false` |

## Directory Structure

The script manages ComfyUI instances in the following directory structure:

```
/workspace/
├── comfyui_gpu0/    # ComfyUI instance for GPU 0
├── comfyui_gpu1/    # ComfyUI instance for GPU 1
├── ...
└── logs/            # Log files
```
